EDMURE: If I may, nephew,

7
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,686
I encountered a situation
with one of my lieutenants

8
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:11,923
at the Stone Mill which
may have some bearing...

9
00:04:12,018 --> 00:04:15,397
Why don't you shut your mouth
about that damned mill?

10
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,129
And don't call him
"nephew." He is your king.

11
00:04:18,225 --> 00:04:19,636
Robb knows I meant him no...

12
00:04:19,726 --> 00:04:23,264
You're lucky I'm not your king.

13
00:04:23,363 --> 00:04:26,867
I wouldn't let you wave your blunders
around like a victory ﬂag.

14
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:29,641
My blunder sent Tywin's mad dog

15
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,580
back to Casterly Rock
with his tail between his legs.

16
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,949
I think King Robb understands
we won't win this war

17
00:04:35,041 --> 00:04:36,681
if he's the only one winning any battles.

18
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:38,053
No, there's glory enough to go around.

19
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:39,954
It's not about glory.

20
00:04:41,782 --> 00:04:44,456
Your instructions were to
wait for him to come to you.

21
00:04:44,551 --> 00:04:45,791
I seized an opportunity.

22
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:47,227
What value was the mill?

23
00:04:48,054 --> 00:04:50,056
The Mountain was garrisoned
across the river from it.

24
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:51,568
ROBB: Is he there now?

25
00:04:51,625 --> 00:04:55,072
Of course not. We took the fight to
him. He could not withstand us.

26
00:04:55,128 --> 00:04:58,337
I wanted to draw the
Mountain into the west,

27
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:02,436
into our country,
where we could surround him and kill him.

28
00:05:02,502 --> 00:05:04,743
I wanted him to chase us,

29
00:05:04,805 --> 00:05:08,082
which he would have done
because he is a mad dog

30
00:05:08,141 --> 00:05:10,246
without a strategic thought in his head.

31
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:13,348
I could have that head on a spike by now.

32
00:05:15,849 --> 00:05:18,261
Instead, I have a mill.

00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:26,331

Willem and Martyn Lannister
are 14 years old.

35
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,374
Martyn is 15, I believe.

36
00:05:34,801 --> 00:05:37,213
Tywin Lannister has my sisters.

37
00:05:38,872 --> 00:05:40,818
Have I sued for peace?

38
00:05:40,874 --> 00:05:42,285
No.

39
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,848
Do you think he'll
sue for peace because we have his father's

40
00:05:46,947 --> 00:05:49,791
brother's great-grandsons?

41
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:55,999
No.

42
00:05:56,056 --> 00:05:57,967
How many men did you lose?

43
00:05:59,559 --> 00:06:03,166
208. But for every man we
lost, the Lannisters...

44
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:06,040
We need our men more than Tywin needs his!

45
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:14,341
I'm sorry.

46
00:06:14,407 --> 00:06:15,408

47
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:16,543

at this gathering, if you had been patient.

49
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,186

short of patience here.

have known about his escape for weeks.

64
00:08:45,325 --> 00:08:49,296
Do you mean to tell me that none of you
has any notion of where he is?

65
00:08:49,362 --> 00:08:50,705
We are trying, my lord.

66
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:52,173
Try harder.

67
00:08:54,634 --> 00:08:56,375
What do we have, then?

68
00:08:56,469 --> 00:08:59,507
Robb Stark and
most of his bannermen are in Riverrun

69
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:03,349
for the funeral
of his grandfather Lord Hoster Tully.

70
00:09:03,410 --> 00:09:08,382
In Stark's absence,
Rouse Bolton holds Harrenhal,

71
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:11,928
which would seem
to make him Lord of Harrenhal,

72
00:09:12,018 --> 00:09:13,019
in practice, not in name.

73
00:09:13,153 --> 00:09:14,188
TYWIN: Let him have it.

74
00:09:14,254 --> 00:09:18,999
The name suits our purposes
far more than that useless pile of rubble.

75
00:09:19,059 --> 00:09:20,538
The Lord of Harrenhal will make

76
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:22,105
a worthy suitor for the widow Arryn.

77
00:09:22,195 --> 00:09:25,267
For which I am
extremely grateful to you, my lord.

78
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,805
Lady Arryn and I have known each
other since we were children.

79
00:09:27,834 --> 00:09:32,840
She has always been
positively predisposed toward me.

80
00:09:32,906 --> 00:09:35,443
A successful courtship would make

81
00:09:35,575 --> 00:09:38,078
Lord Baelish acting Lord of the Vale.

82
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:40,954

83
00:09:41,047 --> 00:09:42,924
You'll leave for the Eyrie
as soon as possible

to the list of people who have
taken up arms against him.

00:09:49,956 --> 00:09:52,937
Far be it from me to hinder true love,

88
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:57,236
but Lord Baelish's
absence would present certain problems.

89
00:09:57,297 --> 00:09:59,709

but a lifetime of outrageous wealth

99
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,899
hasn't taught me much about managing it.

you will prove equal to this challenge.

103
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:35,773
He sniffed and roared and smelled her there

104
00:10:35,835 --> 00:10:38,008
She kicked and wailed, the maid so fair

105
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,584
But he licked the honey from her hair

00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:48,016

110
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:56,158
I hope you're pleased. If I were
armed, they'd never have taken us.

111
00:10:56,256 --> 00:10:58,258
BRIENNE: You were armed
when we were taken.

112
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:00,201
I was in chains, if you recall.

113
00:11:00,293 --> 00:11:04,105
Our little match would have ended quite
quick if my hands weren't bound.

114
00:11:04,164 --> 00:11:07,373
All my life I've been
hearing, "Jaime Lannister,

115
00:11:07,467 --> 00:11:09,174
"what a brilliant swordsman."

116
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:14,175
You were slower
than I expected. And more predictable.

117
00:11:14,274 --> 00:11:15,947
I've been sitting in a muddy pen,

118

119
00:11:17,777 --> 00:11:19,688
I'm a woman. I was beating you.

120
00:11:19,779 --> 00:11:22,020
You were not beating me.

121
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:24,288
Maybe you were as good as people said...

122
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,296
Once.

123
00:11:26,352 --> 00:11:29,458
Or maybe people just
love to over-praise a famous name.

124
00:11:33,626 --> 00:11:37,699
When we make camp tonight,
you'll be raped. More than once.

125
00:11:37,797 --> 00:11:40,676
None of these fellows
have ever been with a noblewoman.

126
00:11:42,902 --> 00:11:45,212
- You'd be wise not to resist.
- Would I?

127
00:11:45,305 --> 00:11:46,648
They'll knock your teeth out.

128
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,149
You think I care?

129
00:11:48,208 --> 00:11:50,552
No, I don't think you
care about your teeth.

130
00:11:54,414 --> 00:11:58,226
If you fight them,
they will kill you' Do you understand?

131
00:11:58,318 --> 00:12:00,889
I'm the prisoner of value, not you.

132
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,399
Let them have
what they want. What does it matter?

133
00:12:03,489 --> 00:12:04,524
What does it matter?

134
00:12:04,591 --> 00:12:05,592
Close your eyes.

135
00:12:05,692 --> 00:12:07,262
Pretend they're Renly.

136
00:12:09,329 --> 00:12:11,536
If you were a woman, you wouldn't resist?

137
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,905
You'd let them do what they wanted?

138
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,245
If I was a woman, I'd make them kill
me. But I'm not, thank the Gods.

139
00:12:23,843 --> 00:12:26,016
If I had a proper forge,
I'd make it good as new.

140
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,425
Doesn't have to look pretty. It just has
to keep the arrows out of my heart.

Why are you helping him?

142

No one's put any chains on you.

147
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,206
So I can walk away, then?

148
00:12:42,262 --> 00:12:45,072

I like to fight up close,

153
00:13:00,713 --> 00:13:04,126
I like to see a man's face
when I put the steel in him.

154
00:13:04,217 --> 00:13:06,754
Why? So you can kiss him?

155
00:13:06,819 --> 00:13:08,662
You remember the last time you were here?

156
00:13:10,123 --> 00:13:12,296

Your father was a stubborn old ox.

195
00:15:55,388 --> 00:15:59,734
I was surprised when he died. Didn't
think death had the patience.

196
00:16:02,061 --> 00:16:06,407
I'm glad you were
with him. I wish to the Gods I had been.

197

Did you make peace in the end?

198
00:16:12,138 --> 00:16:17,417
After 30 years of fighting, I don't
think he remembered what started it.

199
00:16:17,477 --> 00:16:21,118
He asked me to stop
calling myself Blackfish.

200
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:25,651
He said it was an old joke
and it was never funny to begin with.

201
00:16:26,986 --> 00:16:30,331
I told him people
had been calling me Blackfish for so long,

202
00:16:30,423 --> 00:16:32,596
they don't remember my real name.

203
00:16:36,863 --> 00:16:40,606
Every time he would leave for the
capital or fight in a campaign,

204
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:43,838
I'd see him off.

205
00:16:43,936 --> 00:16:47,008
"Wait for me, little Cat," he'd say.

206
00:16:48,374 --> 00:16:52,823
"Wait for me, and I'll come back to you."

207

He's got to remain strong

That he can turn into a wolf at night.

00:27:25,677 --> 00:27:26,917
(SNIFFS) Why?

352
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:29,983
You don't have the strength.
It would kill you.

353
00:27:30,082 --> 00:27:32,756
I'm not easily killed. Men
have tried for years.

354
00:27:37,623 --> 00:27:39,933
I want you.

355
00:27:53,138 --> 00:27:56,483
Your fires burn low, my king.

356
00:27:59,811 --> 00:28:02,382
There is another way. A better way.

357
00:28:03,549 --> 00:28:06,120
You told me your magic
requires a king's blood.

358
00:28:06,185 --> 00:28:07,823
- Yes.
- I'm the one true king.

359
00:28:07,886 --> 00:28:09,365
You are.

360
00:28:09,454 --> 00:28:11,627
There are others
with your blood in their veins.

361
00:28:14,293 --> 00:28:16,534
You will sit on the Iron Throne,

362
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:18,903
but first there must be sacrifices.

363
00:28:18,997 --> 00:28:21,705
The Lord of Light demands it.

364
00:28:33,145 --> 00:28:35,682
The Walk of Punishment
is a warning, Your Grace.

365
00:28:35,747 --> 00:28:37,249
To whom?

366
00:28:37,382 --> 00:28:38,884
JORAH: To any slave who contemplates doing

367
00:28:38,984 --> 00:28:41,555
whatever these slaves did.

368
00:28:41,653 --> 00:28:43,929

369
00:28:44,022 --> 00:28:47,765
Khaleesi, this man
has been sentenced to death.

373
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,342
Leave tonight, I beg you.

374
00:29:02,441 --> 00:29:04,011
And what is she to do for soldiers?

375
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:07,250
BARRISTAN:
We can find sellswords in Pentos and Myr.

376
00:29:07,346 --> 00:29:09,849
Is it "we" already, Ser Barristan?

377
00:29:11,016 --> 00:29:12,757
If you want to sit on the throne

378
00:29:12,884 --> 00:29:14,591
your ancestors built, you must win it.

379
00:29:14,686 --> 00:29:17,030
That means blood on
your hands before the thing is done.

380
00:29:17,089 --> 00:29:20,036
The blood of my enemies,
not the blood of innocents.

381
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:25,640
JORAH: How many wars
have you fought in, Ser Barristan?

382
00:29:25,731 --> 00:29:27,802
- Three.
- Have you ever seen a war

383
00:29:27,899 --> 00:29:30,379
where innocents didn't
die by the thousands?

384
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:38,051
I was in King's Landing
after the sack, Khaleesi.

385
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,284
You know what I saw? Butchery.

386
00:29:41,380 --> 00:29:43,758
Babies, children, old men.

387
00:29:43,815 --> 00:29:46,159
More women raped than you can count.

388
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:50,825
There's a beast in every man, and it
stirs when you put a sword in his hand.

389
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:54,893
But the Unsullied are
not men. They do not rape.

390
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,964
They do not put
cities to the sword unless they're ordered.

391
00:29:58,063 --> 00:30:02,603
If you buy them, the only men they'll
kill are those you want dead.

392
00:30:02,668 --> 00:30:04,306
You disagree, Ser Barristan?

393
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:07,316
When your brother
led his army into battle at the Trident,

394
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:09,909
men died for him
because they believed in him,

395
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,420
because they loved him,

396
00:30:11,476 --> 00:30:14,013
not because they'd been
bought at an auction.

397
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,594
I fought beside the last
dragon on that day.

398
00:30:20,452 --> 00:30:22,329
I bled beside him.

399
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:26,028
Rhaegar fought valiantly,
Rhaegar fought nobly,

400
00:30:26,124 --> 00:30:27,865
and Rhaegar died.

401
00:30:29,795 --> 00:30:31,536
Did you know him well, Ser Barristan?

402
00:30:31,630 --> 00:30:35,203
I did, Your Grace. Finest man I ever met.

403
00:30:36,034 --> 00:30:40,312
I wish I had known him.
But he was not the last dragon.

404

MISSANDEI: All?
Did this one's ears mishear, Your Grace?

405
00:30:55,487 --> 00:30:56,659
They did not. I want to buy them all.

She can't afford them.

The slut thinks she can flash her tits,

410

and make us give her whatever she wants.

411
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:17,881
There are 8,000 Unsullied in Astapor.
Is this what you mean by all?

412
00:31:17,976 --> 00:31:22,049
Yes. 8,000.

they will shame Astapor.

they will bring shame upon all of Astapor.

I will have them all or take none.

420
00:31:41,666 --> 00:31:43,426

I'll need the boys

- But we don't.

Why don't you ask her?

00:48:55,366 --> 00:48:58,438
The North can't win this war.

699
00:48:58,536 --> 00:49:00,641
You're a smart man. You understand that.

700
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,876
We have the numbers. We have the gold.

701
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:04,977
Aye, you have both.

702
00:49:06,544 --> 00:49:10,720
Fighting bravely
for a losing cause is admirable.

703
00:49:11,549 --> 00:49:16,498
Fighting for a winning cause
is far more rewarding.

704
00:49:17,388 --> 00:49:18,890
Hard to argue with that.

705
00:49:22,259 --> 00:49:25,240
Now that we're speaking
together man to man,

706
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:29,642
I wonder if you need
to keep me chained to this tree?

707
00:49:29,733 --> 00:49:32,976
I'm not asking to be freed
from my constraints,

708
00:49:33,070 --> 00:49:35,277
but if I could sleep lying down,

709
00:49:35,406 --> 00:49:37,647
my back would thank you for it.

710
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:41,423
I'm not as young and
resilient as I was once.

711
00:49:42,446 --> 00:49:44,426
None of us are.

712
00:49:46,851 --> 00:49:48,853
Unchain Ser Jaime from the tree.

713
00:49:48,953 --> 00:49:50,296
MAN: Come on, men.

714
00:49:56,927 --> 00:50:00,170
Suppose you'll be wanting something to eat.

715
00:50:00,264 --> 00:50:02,210
I'm famished, actually.

716
00:50:02,299 --> 00:50:05,212
I think we've got a spare
partridge on the fire.

717
00:50:05,302 --> 00:50:07,976
Well, I do like partridge.

(JAIME GROANS SOFTLY)

719
00:50:13,544 --> 00:50:17,390
Bring the bird over here
and the carving knife.

720
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,491
Will this work as a table, my lord?

721
00:50:23,554 --> 00:50:25,329
Oh, yes. Yes, this will do...

722
00:50:25,556 --> 00:50:27,126
(GROANS)

723
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:28,636
On the stump.

724
00:50:35,232 --> 00:50:36,973
You think you're the smartest man there is.

725
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:38,875

That everyone alive
has to bow and scrape and lick your boots.

727
00:50:46,176 --> 00:50:47,314
My father...

728
00:50:47,478 --> 00:50:48,548
And if you get in any trouble,

729
00:50:48,646 --> 00:50:51,718
all you've got to do is say "my father"

730
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:54,659
and that's it, all your troubles are gone.

731
00:50:56,487 --> 00:50:57,727
Don't.

732
00:50:57,855 --> 00:50:59,163
Have you got something to say?

733
00:51:00,057 --> 00:51:01,331
(GRUNTS)

734
00:51:03,494 --> 00:51:06,498
Careful. You don't want
to say the wrong thing.

735
00:51:10,034 --> 00:51:15,074
You're nothing without your
daddy, and your daddy ain't here.

736
00:51:16,106 --> 00:51:18,086
Never forget that.

737
00:51:20,044 --> 00:51:21,682
Here, this should help you remember.
