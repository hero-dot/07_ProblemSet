00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:31,867
I want you...

179
00:16:31,992 --> 00:16:33,660
to leave.

180
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:34,930
17 years ago

181
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:37,474
you rode off with Robert Baratheon.

182
00:17:39,851 --> 00:17:43,021
You came back a year later
with another woman's son.

183
00:17:44,690 --> 00:17:47,234
And now you're leaving again.

184
00:17:49,987 --> 00:17:51,697
I have no choice.

185
00:17:51,822 --> 00:17:55,701
That's what men always say
when honor calls.

186
00:17:55,826 --> 00:17:59,162
That's what you tell your families,
tell yourselves.

187
00:18:00,998 --> 00:18:03,166
You do have a choice.

188
00:18:04,334 --> 00:18:05,836
And you've made it.

189
00:18:10,424 --> 00:18:11,925
Cat...

190
00:18:17,014 --> 00:18:19,474
I can't do it, Ned.

191
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:24,396
I really can't.

192
00:18:24,521 --> 00:18:25,981
You can.

193
00:18:28,525 --> 00:18:29,693
You must.

194
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:56,011
You've said goodbye to Bran?

195
00:18:56,136 --> 00:18:58,138
He's not going to die. I know it.

196
00:18:58,263 --> 00:19:00,432
You Starks are hard to kill.

197
00:19:01,516 --> 00:19:02,976
My mother?

198
00:19:03,101 --> 00:19:05,646
- She was very kind.
- Good.

199
00:19:07,522 --> 00:19:09,650
Next time I see you,
you'll be all in black.

200
00:19:09,775 --> 00:19:11,860
It was always my color.

201
00:19:13,070 --> 00:19:14,821
Farewell, Snow.

202
00:19:14,946 --> 00:19:16,573
And you, Stark.

203
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:11,128
There's great honor serving
in the Night's Watch.

204
00:20:13,296 --> 00:20:16,758
The Starks have manned the Wall
for thousands of years.

205
00:20:17,801 --> 00:20:19,678
And you are a Stark.

206
00:20:19,803 --> 00:20:21,888
You might not have my name,

207
00:20:22,013 --> 00:20:24,015
but you have my blood.

208
00:20:30,647 --> 00:20:32,649
Is my mother alive?

209
00:20:33,358 --> 00:20:36,945
Does she know about me?
Where I am, where I'm going?

210
00:20:37,988 --> 00:20:39,656
Does she care?

211
00:20:40,991 --> 00:20:43,952
The next time we see each other,

212
00:20:44,077 --> 00:20:46,121
we'll talk about your mother.

213
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:47,998
Hmm?

214
00:20:48,123 --> 00:20:49,583
I promise.

217

I've half a mind to leave them
all behind and keep going.

218
00:21:39,716 --> 00:21:41,927
I've half a mind to go with you.

219
00:21:42,052 --> 00:21:46,765
What do you say, just you and me
on the Kingsroad, swords at our sides,

220
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:50,185
a couple of tavern wenches
to warm our beds tonight.

221
00:21:50,310 --> 00:21:52,979
- You should have asked me 20 years ago.
- (CHUCKLES)

222
00:21:53,104 --> 00:21:55,857
There were wars to fight,
women to marry -

223
00:21:55,982 --> 00:21:58,235
we never had the chance to be young.

224
00:21:58,360 --> 00:21:59,986
I recall a few chances.

225
00:22:00,111 --> 00:22:02,280
(LAUGHING)

226
00:22:03,949 --> 00:22:06,493
There was that one...
Oh, what was her name?

227
00:22:06,618 --> 00:22:08,537
That common girl of yours?

228
00:22:08,662 --> 00:22:11,456
Becca. With the great big tits
you could bury your face in.

229
00:22:11,581 --> 00:22:13,792
Bessie.
She was one of yours.

230
00:22:13,917 --> 00:22:17,587
Bessie!
Thank the gods for Bessie.

231
00:22:17,712 --> 00:22:19,297
And her tits.

232
00:22:20,340 --> 00:22:22,759
Yours was, er... Aleena?

233
00:22:22,884 --> 00:22:25,762
No. You told me once. Er... Meryl?

234
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:27,848
Your bastard's mother?

235
00:22:29,641 --> 00:22:31,810
- Wylla.
- That's it.

236
00:22:31,935 --> 00:22:34,020
She must have been a rare wench

237
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:37,023
to make Lord Eddard Stark
forget his honor.

238
00:22:37,148 --> 00:22:39,192
You never told me what she looked like.

239
00:22:40,277 --> 00:22:41,486
Nor will I.

240
00:22:44,114 --> 00:22:45,991
We were at war.

241
00:22:46,116 --> 00:22:48,910
None of us knew if we were
gonna go back home again.

242
00:22:49,035 --> 00:22:52,038
You're too hard on yourself.
You always have been.

243
00:22:54,124 --> 00:22:57,210
I swear if I weren't your king,
you'd have hit me already.

244
00:22:57,335 --> 00:23:00,672
The worst thing about your coronation -

245
00:23:00,797 --> 00:23:02,799
I'll never get to hit you again.

246
00:23:05,135 --> 00:23:07,596
Trust me, that's not the worst thing.

247
00:23:11,641 --> 00:23:13,602
There was a rider in the night.

248
00:23:19,733 --> 00:23:23,194
Daenerys Targaryen has wed
some Dothraki horselord.

249
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:25,155
What of it? Do we send her
a wedding gift?

250
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:27,574
A knife perhaps, a good, sharp one,

251
00:23:27,699 --> 00:23:29,701
and a bold man to wield it.

252
00:23:29,826 --> 00:23:31,620
She's little more than a child.

253
00:23:31,745 --> 00:23:34,998
Soon enough that child will spread her legs
and start breeding.

254
00:23:35,123 --> 00:23:38,752
- Tell me we're not speaking of this.
- Oh, it's unspeakable to you?

255
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:42,172
What her father did to your family -
that was unspeakable.

256
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:44,591
What Rhaegar Targaryen
did to your sister -

257
00:23:44,716 --> 00:23:46,718
the woman I loved.

258
00:23:46,843 --> 00:23:49,888
I'll kill every Targaryen I get my hands on.

259
00:23:50,013 --> 00:23:51,973
But you can't get your hands
on this one, can you?

260
00:23:52,098 --> 00:23:54,684
This Khal Drogo,

261
00:23:54,809 --> 00:23:56,686
it's said he has 100,000 men
in his horde.

262
00:23:56,811 --> 00:23:59,564
Even a million Dothraki
are no threat to the realm,

263
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:02,275
as long as they remain on the other side
of the Narrow Sea.

264
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,361
They have no ships, Robert.

265
00:24:04,486 --> 00:24:07,447
There are still those in the Seven Kingdoms
who call me usurper.

266
00:24:08,615 --> 00:24:12,285
If the Targaryen boy crosses
with a Dothraki horde at his back,

267
00:24:12,410 --> 00:24:15,080
- the scum will join him.
- He will not cross.

268
00:24:16,665 --> 00:24:19,918
And if by chance he does,
we'll throw him back into the sea.

269
00:24:25,006 --> 00:24:27,008
There's a war coming, Ned.

270
00:24:28,176 --> 00:24:31,262
I don't know when,
I don't know who we'll be fighting,

castration or the Wall.

Lovely thing about the Watch -

284
00:26:18,453 --> 00:26:21,748
you discard your old family
and get a whole new one.

00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,634

left me out in the woods to die.

of Casterly Rock.

Things are expected of me.

292
00:26:52,695 --> 00:26:55,115
My father was the Hand of the King
for 20 years.

293
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:57,283
Until your brother killed that king.

294
00:27:03,248 --> 00:27:06,793
Yes, until my brother killed him.

295

296
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:15,135

297
00:27:15,260 --> 00:27:17,720
my repulsive nephew
will be king after him.

298
00:27:20,473 --> 00:27:23,601
I must do my part for the honor of my house.
Wouldn't you agree?

But how?

300
00:27:27,438 --> 00:27:30,191
Well, my brother has his sword

301

and I have my mind,

302
00:27:31,734 --> 00:27:35,738

like a sword needs a Whetstone.

You've got to go. They'll kill you
for what you did to Joffrey.

528
00:47:00,902 --> 00:47:02,988
Go on. Run.

529
00:47:06,199 --> 00:47:08,243
Go! Leave now!

530
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:12,789
- It's a direwolf.
- I'll check down here.

531
00:47:18,712 --> 00:47:21,965
- (WHINES)
- MAN:  I think I heard a noise.

532
00:47:23,300 --> 00:47:25,135
Go!

533
00:47:37,397 --> 00:47:39,941
- (DOGS BARKING)
- NED:  Arya!

534
00:47:40,942 --> 00:47:42,277
MAN: Arya!

535
00:47:43,945 --> 00:47:44,946
NED: Arya!

536
00:47:45,739 --> 00:47:47,949
MAN: Arya!

537
00:47:49,201 --> 00:47:50,660
Arya!

538
00:47:51,328 --> 00:47:52,954
MAN: Arya!

539
00:47:53,080 --> 00:47:55,165
My lord!

540
00:47:55,290 --> 00:47:57,334
My Lord! They've found her.

541
00:47:57,459 --> 00:47:59,961
- She's unharmed.
- MAN:  Arya!

542
00:48:00,087 --> 00:48:02,422
- Where is she?
- She's been taken directly before the king.

543
00:48:02,547 --> 00:48:04,341
- Who took her?
- The Lannisters found her.

544
00:48:04,466 --> 00:48:06,593
- MAN:  Arya!
- Right, get back.

545
00:48:06,718 --> 00:48:09,346
The queen ordered them
to bring her straight to him.

546
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:11,723
Back! Back to the inn!

547
00:48:12,724 --> 00:48:14,476
All back!

548
00:48:22,317 --> 00:48:24,111
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

549
00:48:24,236 --> 00:48:25,779
- Are you hurt?
- No.

550
00:48:25,904 --> 00:48:28,323
Oh, it's all right.

551
00:48:30,117 --> 00:48:32,828
What is the meaning of this?

552
00:48:32,953 --> 00:48:34,955
Why was my daughter
not brought to me at once?

553
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:36,873
How dare you speak to your king
in that manner?

554
00:48:36,998 --> 00:48:38,375
Quiet, woman.

555
00:48:39,668 --> 00:48:42,671
Sorry, Ned. I never meant to frighten the girl.

556
00:48:42,796 --> 00:48:45,090
But we need to get
this business done quickly.

557
00:48:45,841 --> 00:48:48,885
Your girl and that butcher's boy
attacked my son.

558
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:51,138
That animal of hers nearly tore his arm off.

559
00:48:51,263 --> 00:48:53,140
That's not true!

560
00:48:53,265 --> 00:48:55,851
She just... bit him a little.

561
00:48:56,685 --> 00:48:59,312
- He was hurting Mycah.
- Joff told us what happened.

562
00:48:59,438 --> 00:49:02,649
You and that boy beat him with clubs
while you set your wolf on him.

563
00:49:02,816 --> 00:49:04,276
That's not what happened!

564
00:49:04,401 --> 00:49:07,571
Yes, it is! They all attacked me
and she threw my sword in the river.

565
00:49:07,696 --> 00:49:08,864
- Liar!
- Shut up!

566
00:49:08,989 --> 00:49:10,365
ROBERT: Enough!

567
00:49:10,490 --> 00:49:13,410
He tells me one thing,
she tells me another.

568
00:49:13,535 --> 00:49:15,787
Seven hells!
What am I to make of this?

569
00:49:18,039 --> 00:49:20,750
- Where's your other daughter, Ned?
- In bed, asleep.

570
00:49:20,876 --> 00:49:22,878
She's not.

571
00:49:23,003 --> 00:49:25,380
Sansa, come here, darling.

572
00:49:28,592 --> 00:49:30,594
(MURMURING)

573
00:49:36,391 --> 00:49:38,226
Now, child...

574
00:49:39,269 --> 00:49:41,188
tell me what happened.

575
00:49:41,313 --> 00:49:43,356
Tell it all and tell it true.

576
00:49:43,482 --> 00:49:45,984
It's a great crime to lie to a king.

577
00:49:54,493 --> 00:49:56,661
I don't know.

578
00:49:56,786 --> 00:49:59,789
I don't remember.
Everything happened so fast.

579
00:50:00,874 --> 00:50:03,210
- I didn't see.
- Liar!

580
00:50:03,335 --> 00:50:04,794
- Liar, liar, liar!
- Arya!

581
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:07,172
- Hey, stop it! That's enough of that.
- Liar, liar, liar!

582
00:50:07,297 --> 00:50:10,759
- Stop! Arya!
- She's as wild as that animal of hers.

583
00:50:10,884 --> 00:50:12,886
- I want her punished.
- What would you have me do,

584
00:50:13,011 --> 00:50:14,429
whip her through the streets?

585
00:50:14,554 --> 00:50:17,599
Damn it, children fight. It's over.

586
00:50:17,724 --> 00:50:20,352
Joffrey will bear these scars
for the rest of his life.

587
00:50:21,978 --> 00:50:25,440
You let that little girl disarm you?

588
00:50:31,696 --> 00:50:34,658
Ned, see to it that your daughter
is disciplined.

589
00:50:34,783 --> 00:50:37,536
- I'll do the same with my son.
- Gladly, Your Grace.

590
00:50:38,870 --> 00:50:40,789
CERSEI: And what of the direwolf?

591
00:50:41,581 --> 00:50:44,000
What of the beast
that savaged your son?

592
00:50:47,087 --> 00:50:49,422
I'd forgot the damned wolf.

593
00:50:49,548 --> 00:50:52,217
We found no trace of the direwolf,
Your Grace.

594
00:50:52,342 --> 00:50:55,512
No? So be it.

595
00:50:55,637 --> 00:50:57,722
We have another wolf.

596
00:51:01,142 --> 00:51:02,727
As you will.

597
00:51:02,852 --> 00:51:06,106
- You can't mean it.
- A direwolf's no pet.

598
00:51:06,231 --> 00:51:08,358
Get her a dog.
She'll be happier for it.

599
00:51:09,651 --> 00:51:12,237
He doesn't mean Lady, does he?

600
00:51:12,362 --> 00:51:14,948
No, no, not Lady!
Lady didn't bite anyone!

601
00:51:15,073 --> 00:51:17,158
- She's good!
- Lady wasn't there!

602
00:51:17,284 --> 00:51:20,203
- You leave her alone!
- Stop them. Don't let them do it.

603
00:51:20,328 --> 00:51:22,706
Please, please, it wasn't Lady!

604
00:51:22,831 --> 00:51:24,541
Is this your command?

605
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,168
Your Grace?

606
00:51:32,674 --> 00:51:33,675
(DOOR SLAMS)

607
00:51:33,800 --> 00:51:37,137
- Where is the beast?
- Chained up outside, Your Grace.

608
00:51:37,262 --> 00:51:39,222
Ser Ilyn, do me the honor.

609
00:51:39,347 --> 00:51:40,724
No.

610
00:51:41,766 --> 00:51:43,768
Jory...

611
00:51:45,228 --> 00:51:47,272
take the girls to their rooms.

612
00:51:51,568 --> 00:51:53,987
- (SANSA SOBBING)
- If it must be done,

613
00:51:54,112 --> 00:51:56,072
then I'll do it myself.

614
00:51:56,197 --> 00:51:58,241
Is this some trick?

615
00:51:58,366 --> 00:52:00,410
The wolf is of the North.

616
00:52:01,953 --> 00:52:04,372
She deserves better than a butcher.

617
00:52:37,822 --> 00:52:41,409
The butcher's boy -
you rode him down?

618
00:52:41,534 --> 00:52:43,536
He ran.

619
00:52:43,662 --> 00:52:45,246
Not very fast.
