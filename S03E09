537
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:23,955
there's no caging him again. (LAUGHS)

I'm sure you endured yours with grace.

Oh, Ned forbade it.

543
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:44,443
He said it wouldn't be right if he broke
a man's jaw on our wedding night.

(CHUCKLES)

545
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:56,221
That is a very strange custom.

546
00:40:56,721 --> 00:40:59,998
I suppose it does seem strange
from a foreigner's perspective.

547

It seems normal to you?

548

It's a tradition.

Without the bedding ceremony,
there's no real proof

550
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,609
the lord and lady
consummated their marriage.

551
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:14,741
No, but there
are other ways of providing proof.

I don't know.

554
00:41:23,247 --> 00:41:26,091
But if it's a boy,
I know what we should name him.

00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:27,823
Oh, do you?

556
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:31,795
It seems to me the father
should have some say in his son's naming.
